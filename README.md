# Next-Gen-Visual-Models
Project explores the evolution of image generation, from autoencoders, GANs to SD &amp; the new VAR (Visual Autoregressive Representation) method. VAR enhances image quality and scalability beyond diffusion models. Weâ€™ll analyze each stage, explore unique emerging techniques, and work toward developing a novel approach in the near future.
