# Plan 1: Foundation for Beginners in Machine Learning

This plan is ideal for those completely new to machine learning, particularly in **regression** and **classification**, or anyone aiming to build a strong foundation. It covers pre-deep learning techniques and essential supervised learning methods.

## Course Outline
1. **Machine Learning Techniques Overview**: Introduction to classical ML techniques before deep learning.
2. **Supervised Learning Specialization**:
   - [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) â€“ Recommended for structured learning.
3. **Hands-on with Scikit-Learn**:
   - Tutorials on basic ML models using scikit-learn.
   - [Linear Regression Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html)
   - [Classifier Comparison](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html)

## Assignments
- **Week 1**: Add detailed comments in the code for tutorials, including descriptions of classifiers.
- **Submission**: One Jupyter Notebook with code, explanations, and references to materials used.
